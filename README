README : CMLT written by Ashay Tamhane
------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++ Machine Learning Toolkit (CMLT) is a ML library built from scratch (without using helper libraries).
You are free to use the code in any way you want, preferably along with a citation :)

Kindly go through the INSTALL file to get started. Please refer to
the docs folder for functionality documentation. The examples folder is
the best way to get started on using CMLT.

Thanks for trying out CMLT!
