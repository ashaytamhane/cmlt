README : CMLT written by Ashay Tamhane
------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++ Machine Learning Toolkit (CMLT) is my humble effort
at creating a ML library from scratch (without using helper libraries).
This library is NOT meant for people looking for ML libraries to be used
for industrial purposes, as it is not optimized/foolproof in any way 
whatsoever. The sole purpose of this library is to get a detailed 
understanding of various methods and algorithms. You are free to use the
code in any way you want, preferably along with a citation :)

The 0.1 version of this library has a very limited scope, mainly with 
focus on various matrix operations. It also supports a simple version of
linear regression.

Kindly go through the INSTALL file to get started. Please refer to
the docs folder for functionality documentation. The examples folder is
the best way to get started on using CMLT.

Thanks for trying out CMLT!
